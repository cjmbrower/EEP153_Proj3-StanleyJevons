We are focusing our analysis on the population of Guatemala in the year 2000. This year was selected primarily because (a) it is the only year available in our dataset, and (b) it represents a pivotal moment in Guatemala’s recent history, marked by the influence of various legislative policies and political actions that have shaped the country’s rich cultural and social landscape.
For our comparison, we have selected the population of Panama in the 1997. This population was chosen due to Panama’s own cultural diversity and its geographic and historical ties to Guatemala, which allow for a meaningful regional comparison and deeper insights into Central American demographic dynamics.
